We are aware of websites, emails, SMS text messages and phone calls falsely claiming to offer registration for COVID-19 vaccination. Please note that registration for the COVID-19 vaccination can only be done via vaccine.gov.sg. We advise the public to check the [MOH Website]( www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination) for information on Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination programme. 

Please always verify the authenticity of instructions before offering any personal or financial information. You can also call the MOH hotline at 1800-333-9999 if you have any queries. Thank you.
